# Digit-Recognition
  This projects trains an ANN with one hidden layer of 30 neurons using backpropogation algorithm to recognise handwritten digits.

# Data-Set-Used
  I have used the MNIST data set to train the network for 10,000 images.
  You can learn more about the data set here http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
  Basically the MNIST data set contains a set of 60,000 training images and it also contains 10,000 test images of 28*28 pixels which we     have converted into a matrix of 784*1
  The data set cloned or downloaded from the DATA SET directory or you can download it from this link           https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RkvokHfxD4WkRHwPJ0H9dcjRyc8r6X7z
